    "summary": "The CEH-GEAR1hr-v2 dataset contains 1-km grids of hourly rainfall estimates for GB for the period 1990-2017. The gridded rainfall estimates are derived by applying the nearest neighbour interpolation method to hourly raingauge observations. These interpolated hourly estimates were then used to temporally disaggregate the daily CEH-GEAR dataset (https://doi.org/10.5285/33604ea0-c238-4488-813d-0ad9ab7c51ca). The dataset also contains, for each day, a grid containing, for each grid point, the distance between the grid point and the closest recording raingauge used in its interpolation.  When this distance is greater than 50 km, or there is 0mm rainfall recorded in the closest gauge the daily value is disaggregated using a design storm. The dataset therefore also contains for each day, a grid containing for each grid point a flag showing if the design storm was used. These grids are provided as an indicator of the quality of the estimates.",
